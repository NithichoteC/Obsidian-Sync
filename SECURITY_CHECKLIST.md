## üîí CouchDB Security Checklist

### Authentication & Access Control

- [ ] **Admin password:** Strong, randomly generated (32+ characters)
- [ ] **Password stored securely:** Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
- [ ] **Admin panel disabled:** Or restricted to localhost only
- [ ] **require_valid_user enabled:** All requests require authentication

**Verify:**
```bash
curl https://couchdb.yourdomain.com/_utils/
# Should require login, not open publicly
```

### Network Security

- [ ] **HTTPS only:** HTTP redirect enabled
- [ ] **TLS 1.2+ only:** Disable older protocols
- [ ] **Valid SSL certificate:** Let's Encrypt auto-renewal working
- [ ] **Certificate monitoring:** Alerts before expiry

**Check SSL:**
```bash
curl -I https://couchdb.yourdomain.com
# Should show: HTTP/2 200 or HTTP/1.1 200
# Should NOT show security warnings
```

### IP Allowlisting (Level 2)

**Recommended for agency data.**

- [ ] **Coolify IP restrictions enabled**
- [ ] **Office IP added** to allowlist
- [ ] **Home IP added** to allowlist
- [ ] **Mobile IP range added** (if needed)
- [ ] **Backup access method** documented (in case IP changes)

**How to implement in Coolify:**

1. Go to CouchDB service ‚Üí Settings
2. Add environment variable:
   ```
   ALLOWED_IPS=1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8/24
   ```
3. Or use Coolify's built-in IP allowlist feature
4. Test access from allowed/blocked IPs

**Find your IP:**
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

### Database Security

- [ ] **Regular backups configured** (daily minimum)
- [ ] **Backup encryption enabled**
- [ ] **Backup restoration tested** (at least once)
- [ ] **Old backups rotated** (keep last 30 days)

**Backup command:**
```bash
docker exec obsidian-couchdb couchdb-backup \
  -u admin -p YOUR_PASSWORD \
  -H localhost -d obsidian \
  -f /backup/obsidian-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

**Verify API is local-only:**
```bash
# This should work (from same machine):
curl http://127.0.0.1:27124/ -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"

# This should fail (from different machine):
curl http://your-server-ip:27124/
# Should: Connection refused
```
